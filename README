# SQL Explorer Plugin

Barebones ChatGPT Plugin for interacting with an SQL Database through SQLAlchemy.

## Installation
Run this inside of the repository directory:

```bash
pip install -e .
database-explorer
```

## Usage

The server reads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to the database. By default it runs with the `chinook.db` sqlite database in this repo.

Once running, you can play with the API and view the spec at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
